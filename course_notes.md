### Lecture 4 - Basie HTML Document Structure
The bare minimum doc must have a `<!doctype html>` tag first, then a `<html>` tag with `<header>` and `<body>` tags in that order. The `<header>` usually has a `<meta>` tag along with a `<title>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

	<head>
	    <meta charset="UTF-8">
	    <title>Document</title>
	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
</html>
```
The body tag can have many different tags within it.
